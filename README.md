## Goals for the Game
#### Player Driven Economy
An economy that is mostly controlled by players. Almost everything in the game is made by players and exchanges hands until it is eventually lost or destroyed. The ingame currency will be used as a medium for players to exchange goods, and the value of the good will be determined entirely by the players and the rules of supply and demand.  
### Skill Based PvP
In order for items to have any kind of value, there needs to be a specific use for them. The main use case for a lot of items will be in player on player combat. There will be some kind of world PvP, whether in only specific areas or in majority of the map to give players a sense of risk when adventuring that NPC mobs can't really give.  
It is likely that PvP will be a good form of income for players that become decently skilled at it, and in order for this to happen there needs to be enough mechanics to the point where a player has only a few reasonable options out of many when deciding how to respond to a situation. Players will drop some of their expensive items, while others will be destroyed to battle inflation.  
### Progression aside from PvP
Though PvP will be a major focus, there needs to be a way for the player to progress in the world in other ways. There should be a reason to fill certain professions and needs in the economy and community to make money, such as being a bodyguard, selling materials, loaning backpack space, offering item improvement services etc.
### Community
Eventually there will be a way for players to form communities with friends in game by building up their own medieval cities. Player built cities will all have to be managed individually, and the focus will be on politics and the logistics of organising a group of people. Is it a democracy? A communist state?  
Combat will be eventually also expanded to include siege warfare, allowing guilds to fight each other in large scale battles.
